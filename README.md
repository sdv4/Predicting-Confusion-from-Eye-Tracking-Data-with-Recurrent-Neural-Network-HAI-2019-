# Predicting Confusion from Eye Tracking Data with Recurrent Neural Network-HAI 2019
Code for models and experiments presented in _Predicting Confusion from Eye-Tracking Data with Recurrent Neural Network_. This paper is to be presented at the [Humanizing AI workshop of IJCAI 2019](https://www.humanizing-ai.com/hai-19.html) on August 12, 2019 in Macao, China.

This code is being made available to allow others to verify our procedure so that it can be used in other in related applications of eye-tracking data.


Please contact me if you notice any errors, have any suggestions, or just want to chat about classifying eye-tracker data using deep learning approaches. 


### note: The dataset required to run these experiments has not been made publicly available.
